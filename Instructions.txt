Programming Language: Java

Solution1:
	My solution is a maven project and includes "com.googlecode.json-simple" dependency.
The program gets input file path from command line argument.

Solution2:
	I assumed that if reading file(IO) and processing data be executed on two parallel threads will reduce time for waiting IO operations. I used Producer-Consumer approach for this problem.
